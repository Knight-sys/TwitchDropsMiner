If you want to mine specific games first, use the \"Priority\" list to set up an ordered list of games of your choice. Games from the top of the list will be attempted to be mined first, before the ones lower down the list.\n5. Keep the \"Priority mode\" selected as \"Priority list only\", to avoid mining games that are not on the priority list. Or not - it's up to you.\n6. Use the \"Exclude\" list to tell the application which games should never be mined.\n7.
