## ⚠️ Notes & Warnings

> ⚠️ **Avoid Watching on the Same Account**  
> Watching Twitch manually while the miner runs can cause progress desync.  
> Use a different account if you want to watch live streams while mining.

> 💡 **Requirements**  
> Python 3.10+  
> Docker optional but recommended  
> Persistent data stored in `/data`

## 🧑‍💻 Original Project Credits

<!---
Note: The translations credits are sorted alphabetically, based on their English language name.
When adding a new entry, please ensure to insert it in the correct place in the second section.
Non-translations related credits should be added to the first section instead.

Note: When adding a new credits line below, please add two trailing spaces at the end
of the previous line, if they aren't already there. Doing so ensures proper markdown
rendering on Github. In short: Each credits line should end with two trailing spaces,
placed past the period character at the end.

• Last line can have the two trailing spaces omitted.
• Please ensure your editor won't trim the trailing spaces upon saving the file.
• Please ensure to leave a single empty new line at the end of the file.
